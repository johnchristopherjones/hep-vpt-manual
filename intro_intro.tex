This document was written in \LaTeX, and was compiled with \XeTeX~0.94 from Mac\TeX\ 2009 for Unicode support.  The Lucida Grande font is used for sans-serif typefaces, available on Mac~OS~X.
%The free/libre DejaVu Sans Mono was used for the monospaced font.
Anonymous Pro is used for the monospaced font, also available on Mac~OS~X.

A number of \LaTeX{} packages were used.
The document was typeset with the \textit{Memoir} class.
Graphics are provided with the {\TikZ} package.
The glossary was constructed with the \texttt{glossaries} package.
Tables make use of the \texttt{booktabs} and \texttt{multirow} packages.
Links are provided by the \texttt{hyperref} package.
Several other packages are loaded for symbol support: \texttt{amsmath},
    \texttt{textcomp}, \texttt{ucs}, \texttt{xunicode}, \texttt{xltxtra}.
%Finally, I use \texttt{xcolor} for non-hyperlinked colored text, and
%    \texttt{listings} for code listings.
