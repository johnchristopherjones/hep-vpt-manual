\section{Warnings}
\label{sec:eq_magnet}

\begin{avoid} bringing magnetic materials near the magnet.  The strength of the magnetic field grows inversely to the \textit{cube} of distance---that is, much faster than intuition may suggest.  Screwdrivers, metallic watches, and even metal glasses have been known to be pulled off of individuals passing by the magnet.  \textit{Remember to remove your wallet before approaching 10\,000~gauss line near the magnet}, because it \textit{will} erase your credit cards.\end{avoid}

\begin{avoid} proximity to the magnet if you carry medical equipment, including remote monitors and pacemakers.\end{avoid}

\begin{avoid} contact with the outer casing while the high voltage is active.  The central cavity of the magnet houses high voltage equipment.  Although the outer casing of the magnet \textit{should not} carry an electric potential, improper grounding, wiring, or cable failure may occur.  The high voltage to this equipment should be powered down before touching the outer casing of the magnet or the rig.\end{avoid}
