\section{Cleaning}
\label{sec:op_vpt:cleaning}

Only the photocathode face needs to be cleaned.  Fingerprints should be wiped away using disposable lens cloths.  A small green cardboard box of \textit{Kimwipes Delicate Task Wipers} is usually located near the rig for easy access.

\section{Mounting VPTs}
\label{sec:op_vpt:mounting}

Each VPT has three cables connected to the anode (tan/white), dynode (blue), and cathode (gold/yellow).  The cathode is sometimes labeled with the letter ``K'' from the Russian spelling.  The dynode and cathode colors can be remembered with the euphemistic mnemonic as ``KY dB.''
