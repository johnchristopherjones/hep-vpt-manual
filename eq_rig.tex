\label{sec:eq_rig}

The rig is a mounting system attached to the superconducting magnet.  It includes mounts for the VPTs themselves, in addition to the LED pulser boards and the Stephenson amplifiers.

The current rig was assembled during the 2009\dashen2010 school year by Michael Balazs, Brian Francis, and Benjamin H.\ ``BH'' Kent (Associate Machine Shop Foreman).  It features a number of improvements over the previous rig:

It can accomodate up to five (5) VPTs at once, up from two.  It also has a notched lever on the rear to rotate the VPTs from $-25^\circ \to +25^\circ$, up from $0 \to 23^\circ$.

A new housing has been constructed for the LED boards, VPTs, and amplifiers.  The LED boards are now mounted inside the field near the VPTs, clearing a large amount of floorspace that was used for an articulating arm that protruded out of the field and limited the angle of rotation available for the VPTs.



\section{Amplifier Board}
\label{sec:eq_preamp}

The \glspl{VPT} are connected directly to a high-speed low-noise charge amplifier.  At the heart of the amplifier circuit is a {National Semiconductor CLC428} (\href{papers/CLC428}{datasheet}), which is the ``Stephenson pre-amp chip.''  The amplifiers were supplied by Mike Arenton and are similar to those used in CMS.


\section{LED Pulser Boards}
\label{sec:eq_led}

Mike Arenton also supplied the LED pulser boards, which are similar to the ones supplied to CMS.  These are the boards which supply blue or orange light pulses to the 14,000 VPTs in the CMS endcaps to stablize their gain between beam events.
