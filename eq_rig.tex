\label{sec:eq_rig}

The rig is a mounting system attached to the superconducting magnet.  It includes mounts for the VPTs themselves, in addition to the LED pulser boards and the Stephenson amplifiers.

The current rig was assembled during the 2009\dashen2010 school year by Michael Balazs, Brian Francis, and Benjamin H.\ ``BH'' Kent (Associate Machine Shop Foreman).  It features a number of improvements over the previous rig:

It can accomodate up to five (5) VPTs at once, up from two.  It also has a notched lever on the rear to rotate the VPTs from $-25^\circ \to +25^\circ$, up from $0 \to 23^\circ$.

The LED boards are now mounted inside the field near the VPTs, clearing a large amount of floorspace that was used for an articulating arm that protruded out of the field and limited the angle of rotation available for the VPTs.  A new housing has been constructed for the LED boards, VPTs, and Stephenson amplifiers.
