\subsection{Cryogen System}
\label{sec:op_magnet:cryogens}

\subsubsection{Liquid Nitrogen}
\label{sec:op_magnet:cryogens:ln2}

The liquid nitrogen boils off at a rate of 10\,\% per day in the vicinity of 100\,\% full.  The rate increases somewhat as the tank approaches empty.  It's generally good policy to keep the LN2 level as high as possible, filling on Mondays and Fridays in case a fill must be missed for some reason.

The liquid nitrogen is usually delivered in 240\,L dewars, such as the Taylor-Wharton XL-65 dewar.

\subsubsection{Liquid Helium}
\label{sec:op_magnet:cryogens:lhe}

The liquid helium boils off at a rate of 10\,\% per week.  One full 250\,L liquid helium dewar will fill the magnet's tank from 20\,\% to around 95\,\%.
