\label{chap:eq_low_voltage}

Most of the pieces of equipment in the rig have low voltage and current requirements.  For our external power supply, we use two \makemodel{BK Precision}{9130} Triple Output Programmable DC Power Supplies.

The \makemodel{BK Precision}{9130} Triple Output Programmable DC Power Supply has three independent outputs  providing 0\dashen30\,V \& 0\dashen3\,A on two channels, and 0\dashen5\,V \& 0\dashen3\,A on a third.  It can be remotely controlled over USB or RS232.  It is also rack mountable, at 2\,U$\times$½\,U.

Table \ref{tab:eq_low_voltage:external_settings} lists the voltage each channel is set to, and what it is currently connected to.  Table \ref{tab:eq_low_voltage:external_cables} lists the cables which require low voltage supplies and where they're currently connected.

The FPGA is capable of meeting the voltage and current requirements for the LED boards, and directly connecting them would also allow the LED bias to be controlled directly by the FPGA.  That would permit us to control the photocurrent automatically.  They were removed from the FPGA while tracking down a source of signal noise, and may be safely re-attached to the FPGA at a later date.

The ``Trigger Pulse Generator Chip'' is a pair of a \model{74LS241N} and \model{74LS241PC} line drivers, chips designed to be able to drive signals over BNC cables.  The trigger signals run from the FPGA to the generator chips and then on to the LED boards themselves.  The FPGA isn't capable of driving the BNC cables directly.
