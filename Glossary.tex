\newglossaryentry{SHVC}{
  name=SHVC,
  description={An acronym for Safe High Voltage (SHV) Connector, it is a connector similar in appearance to a BNC connector, but designed to be safe carrying much higher voltages and currents than traditional BNC connectors.  Like BNC, the connectors are used on co-axial cables.  SHV connectors cannot be mated with low voltage BNC terminals, or vice versa.  SHV connectors are visually distinguishable from BNC connectors by their thick protruding insulator.  They are designed so that high voltage contact is broken before the grounding contact is, protecting the user from shock}}
